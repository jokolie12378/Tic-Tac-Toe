# Tic-Tac-Toe
C++ Program

Overview:
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C++. The game is designed for two players to 
take turns and play on a 3x3 grid. The players alternate between 'X' and 'O', trying to be the 
first to get three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
The game is played entirely in the console, and the current state of the board is 
displayed after each move.

Currently, the game supports two-player gameplay, but I am actively working on implementing an 
AI opponent so players can compete against the computer.

Features:
Two-player gameplay: Players take turns marking cells with 'X' or 'O'.
Grid display: The game board is displayed after each move.
Win condition check: The game checks for a winner after each move.
Input validation: Ensures that players select valid positions on the board

How to Play
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled program.
3. Players will be prompted to enter a position on the 3x3 grid (1-9) to place their mark (either 'X' or 'O').
4. After each move, the updated board will be displayed.
5. The game will automatically check for a winner and declare the result once a player wins or the game ends in a draw.

Future Plans:
AI Opponent: Work is in progress to add a computer opponent, allowing players to play against the AI. 
The AI will be designed to make strategic moves based on the current state of the board.
Difficulty Levels: I plan to implement multiple difficulty levels for the AI, such as easy, medium, 
and hard, to offer varying challenges to players.
